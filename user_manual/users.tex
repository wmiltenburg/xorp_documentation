\chapter{User Management}

Currently, XORP does not support user management. If XORP is running on a
multi-access UNIX system, an user who needs an access to XORP must have an
UNIX account on that system. See Chapter~\ref{livecd} for information about
user management if XORP is running from a LiveCD.

Any user on a multi-access UNIX system can start and use \xorpsh
in operational mode. However, only users that belong to the ``xorp''
UNIX group can run \xorpsh in configurational mode.

In the future XORP will provide better user access control mechanism,
and will provide a mechanism for user management (\eg adding and deleting
users that can access XORP, etc).
